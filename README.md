# Test-Driven Development Kata Starter Project
The goal of this project is to give developers a simple, project for practicing. -- both those with experience praciceing TDD and those who are new to the pracice -- using katas.  learn how to write unit tests using Test-Driven Development (TDD) and practicing using TDD katas.

What is TDD & how does it differ from unit testing?

Though TDD can apply to a number of different types of tests, this project focuses on applying TDD to unit testing. While unit testing often involves writing tests *after* code is feature-complete, TDD 

it is a style of unit testing where software is developed alongside unit tests, but where the unit tests are always a step ahead of the software itself. If you're unfamiliar with TDD, the idea of writing tests *before* feature code would seem odd. [Uncle Bob's "Three Rules of TDD"](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd) captures the workflow very succinctly:  

> 1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
> 1. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
> 1. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.


## Introductory Reading
- [Practice](http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd/)
- [Uncle Bob's "Three Rules of TDD"](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd)
- [TDD Test-driven development cycle from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#Test-driven_development_cycle):  another perspective on the "Three Rules"

These are short; I'll wait.

## What's in this project
- `reqiurements.txt` 3.8, should work w/other versions. Install requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt
- a starter this project has everything you'll need to get started learning TDD with Python and `pytest`. 
### Commands
- `pytest`
- `ptw`
- `pytest --cov=src` If you're interested in coverage

# What's not in this project?
mocking libraries like `mockito`. While learning to leverage powerful mocking libraries is an important part of learning to write properly-isolated unit tests, that is not the goal of this project and such resources have been intentionally excluded.

## What should I do now?
Fork this project and make it your own. There's a starter string calculator test file, but feel free to create your own. add other katas, etc. Don't like the string calculator starter files that I provided? Delete them and create your own!
